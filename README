This is a fun little project I am designing in my free time to make Dungeon
Mastering easier.

To run the program execute the 'run' script located in the bin directory.

To run all of the current tests execute the 'run_tests' script in the bin
directory.

To run a single test or test suite execute the 'run_tests' script in the
bin directory with the name of the test or test suite you want to run.

Example:
    To run a test suite named Database in the DMProgram/dmprogram/tests/tests
    directory you would run:

        ./run_tests Database

    To run a test named test_create_player in the Database suite you would
    run:

        ./run_tests Database/test_create_player.py
