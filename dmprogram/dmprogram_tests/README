When writing tests there are a few necessary requirements:

    1) The test suite directories must have an __init__.py file
    2) The test file names must contain 'test_' in order to be picked up
    by the tester
    3) The tests in each file must be in a class whose name begins with
    'Test' (such as class TestPlayer) and the class must be a child of
    unittest.TestCase
    4) Each test class must contain a class method called 'setup_class' that
    must at least print the name of the file being tested

Look at the already completed tests for examples.
